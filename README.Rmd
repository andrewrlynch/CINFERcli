CINFER produces scDNAseq-based estimates of chromosome mis-segregation rates. It uses a pre-simulated dataset of over 50,000 simulated populations growing with varying levels of chromosomal instability and selective pressure of aneuploid populations.

We have shown that this method can recall experimentally observed mis-segregation rates as well as those most likely to have resulted in the karyotype diversity observed in patient-derived clinical samples.

This web version of CINFER implements a model of stabilizing karyotype selection that selects against cells with imbalanced karyotypes.
