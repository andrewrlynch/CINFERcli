<!-- badges: end -->

CINFER produces scDNAseq-based estimates of chromosome mis-segregation rates. It uses a pre-simulated dataset of over 50,000 simulated populations growing with varying levels of chromosomal instability and selective pressure of aneuploid populations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CINFERcli from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```
devtools::install_github('mskilab-org/JaBbA')
```
