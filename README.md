CINFER produces scDNAseq-based estimates of chromosome mis-segregation
rates. It uses a pre-simulated dataset of over 50,000 simulated
populations growing with varying levels of chromosomal instability and
selective pressure of aneuploid populations.

## Installation

You can install the development version of CINFERcli from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

    devtools::install_github('andrewrlynch/CINFERcli')
