# CINFERcli

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

CINFER produces scDNAseq-based estimates of chromosome mis-segregation
rates. It uses a pre-simulated dataset of over 50,000 simulated
populations growing with varying levels of chromosomal instability and
selective pressure of aneuploid populations.

## Installation

    devtools::install_github('andrewrlynch/CINFERcli')

## Usage

If you use CINFER, kindly cite:
